## CHANCE
Community Health And Network Connection Environment (CHANCE for short)

### Project Description
A Web App that provides a low cost EHR (electronic health record) and patient connectivity for any type of community health provider.   

### Problem statement
Small clinics, wellness providers and independent community health providers can't afford the rising cost of EHR systems and don't have an efficient way managing patient information and connectivity.

### How will your project solve this problem?
CHANCE offers to clinicians everywhere a fully functioning, personalized, electronic health record system with all the bells and whistles of very expensive EHRs.  It brings a scaleable and portable application to providers and their patients with an emphasis on making it easy for the clinical staff as well as the patients.       

### Map the user experience
For the MVP, the splash page will tell about CHANCE and what we do.  From there the user will be able to go to the clinician portal or the patient portal.  The patient will have access to all their own information and current results.  The clinician will sign on to see a current list of patients and the clinician has access to any of the patient information in the clinician's patient database.  Both the clinician and the patient will be able to communicate with each other within the application.

Way too ambitious things to do that may be realized after I complete the MVP:
  - Internal Payment/Billing system
  - Adding a Hospital and/or Guest Portal to the network

### What technologies do you plan to use?
Frontend: React.js (unfamiliar tech) HTML5/CSS3
Backend: Heroku, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
